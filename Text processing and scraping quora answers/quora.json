Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant\u2019s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).\nBlockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.\nBlockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.

            "answer": "The blockchain is an up-to-date technology expecting to bring innovativeness in a variety of business industries. Blockchain implementation can provide a lot of benefits, affecting different business processes. A blockchain is a database with user distributed validation.

            "answer": "I learned about blockchain in 2012, from the man who nearly burned my apartment down.\nHe was supposed to cat-sit while my wife and I honeymooned in Thailand. Feeling cold, he turned the heater on and our place caught on fire.\nIt was summer.\nIn San Francisco.\nThe firefighters arrived just in time. And seeing that the cats and our place were all fine, I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it.\n\u201cHave you heard about Bitcoin?\u201d he told me.\n\u201cBit-what?!\u201d\nSo I read the white paper\n.\nI was a mergers & acquisitions lawyer at the time.\nAttorneys make whole careers based on the premise that you can never prove that something happens. They bend and twist the truth in the way that most suits the needs of their clients.\nBut this blockchain, it was something else.\n\u201cThis is the first time in history we can verify that something happened at a definitive point in time without depending on an intermediary,\u201d I thought.\nUntil then, records of transactions had to be kept with a 3rd party and would be suspect to tampering. But with blockchain, trust is safely spread out.\nAnother way to look at is by understanding the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem. Several armies surround a city. If they all attack at the same time, they can triumph. If they all retreat at the same time, they can save themselves.\nBut anything in between, and there\u2019ll be death. A lot of it.\nIt\u2019s the fundemantal human problem of trust. One general can tell the others that he\u2019ll be attacking, but they can\u2019t know it for a fact until they themselves either attack or retreat.\nBlockchain, on the other hand, is a public ledger recording transactions with timestamps on a vastly distributed network of computers. If one person decides to tell a different story, they won\u2019t be able to.\nToo many records on too many nodes will prevent that.\nRevolutionary.\nBlockchain naysayers aren\u2019t rare.\nWhen email was invented, they said it\u2019s too impersonal and people would never use it. Phone companies used to state that no one would ever communicate over anything but a phone line. Traditional media believed banner ads wouldn't be effective in comparison with printed ads.\nThey were all wrong.\nAnd here\u2019s the point.\nBlockchain is already powering technologies that are transforming our lives\n.\nIn healthcare, it\u2019s being used to track the progress of patients after they leave the hospital. In finance, cryptocurrencies allow for effecting payments in a non-centralized way and without the control of central governments. Smart contracts are changing how we do business and reducing bureaucratic hoops. Precious gems are being monitored to ensure they\u2019re free of child labor and tyranny. Even governments are using blockchain to increase efficiency.\nHow wide-ranging will blockchain\u2019s implications be?\nStick around and you\u2019ll find out."
